# Welcome to my First Website

This is my first React project. On an initial stage, I had introduced myself to HTML, CSS and JS using the online educational platform [https://freecodecamp.org/]freecodecamp.org. Later on, I've analysed other websites' source code and tried implementing, in my way, some interesting features to my website. 

I would like to give credits to a particular portoflio website, which inspired me since the beginning of this journey.

## Review

I'd be happy if you went through my code and give some feedback! I am quite sure that many components I had implemented could be improved and substituited by mere better code. Feel free to get in contact with me if you would like to point out any major issue. Thank you in advanced!

## Purpose

I intended to develop my own personal website as an introduction in the web-development world and as an excuse to learn the MERN stack. However, this website is mere front-end. Perhaps in a near future, I will dive into the backend bone of web-development. 

Furthermore, this website will serve me as an online curriculum if you will. A common way for developers to show their skills, not just on paper.
