# Welcome to my portfolio

This is my first React project. On an initial stage, I had introduced myself to HTML, CSS and JS using the online educational platform [https://freecodecamp.org/]freecodecamp.org.

## Packages

If you wish to go through my code, I had used a few packages. From tsparticles to framer. I am quite sure that many components I had implemented could be improved and substituited by other packages or mere better code. Feel free to get in contact with me if you would like to point out any major issue. Thank you in advanced!

## Purpose

I intended to develop my own personal website as an introduction in the web-development world and as an excuse to learn the MERN stack. However, in this website I did not use express.js nor Mongo.DB. Perhaps in a near future I dive myself into the backend bone of web-development. 

Furthermore, this website will serve me as an online curriculum if you will. A common way for developers to show their skills, not just on paper.
